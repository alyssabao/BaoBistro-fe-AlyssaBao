# Project Brief: Bao Bistro

*Bao Bistro* is the official website for my dad's restaurant, based in Da Nang.

### Motivations + Problems

As the world becomes increasingly technologically reliant, more and more people are turning to the internet for all their needs. That includes food and food delivery. Being able to see an online menu will help sales.

I am interested in working on this project because I want to help my dad's business succeed.

My dad would like to implement a feature that will allow visitors to the website to order food directly from the website. I anticipate that this feature will be very difficult to implement.

### Key Features and Technical Implementation Plan
